# Todo App with Redux Toolkit and LocalStorage

A simple Todo application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, designed to manage tasks efficiently. This version introduces global state management using Redux Toolkit and persists data using **localStorage**. It improves upon the previous Todo application by providing a scalable and maintainable structure.

## 📝 Features

- **Add Todos**: Create new todos with unique IDs.
- **Edit Todos**: Modify existing todos directly within the interface.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: All tasks are stored in localStorage, allowing them to persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Global State Management**: Uses Redux Toolkit for centralized state management.
  
## 🆚 Differences from Previous Version

This version of the Todo app has several enhancements:

- **Redux Toolkit**: Implements centralized state management for better scalability and maintainability.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Todos are now saved to the browser’s localStorage, preventing data loss on page reload.
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Uses **slices** to manage state, separating actions and reducers for a more modular codebase.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage global state with actions and reducers.
- **LocalStorage**: To store todos persistently.
- **React Icons**: For UI enhancements.
